- Description: The goal of this project is to build a predictive model for gold prices using market and economic indicators.
  Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms were used to forecast future gold prices based on historical data and financial indicators.
  The model achieved an R-squared accuracy of 80%, indicating a high level of predictive performance.
